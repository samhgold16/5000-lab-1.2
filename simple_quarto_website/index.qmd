## Fun Math!

After studying statistics in undergrad and starting this degree, I have begun to see Baye's Theorem, $\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(B \mid A)\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)}$, in my sleep! But if $\Pr(A)$ and $\Pr(B)$ are independent or mutually exclusive, who cares! Still, you can do some pretty fun things with Baye's Theorem. Like the transformation below:

$$\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(B \mid A)\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)} = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)}$$

## Extra Notes

It's always important to both cite and footnote your text, the extra information and content will surely help the reader if they have questions[^1].

[^1]: But who checks footnootes, they're boooring.

If you ever include a quote in you're writing, unless you mention the speaker or author, you should definitely add a footnote for the source. For instance, someone once said: 

> "Once upon a time, a time waltzed upon a clock"[^2]

In response to this thought-provoking message, someone responded with:

> "I do"[^3]

[^2]: Really? Who would've ever said this.
[^3]: Someone getting married.

## Media

Here are some sports graphics I made using photoshop when I was a student at the University of Michigan.

And here is a video of one of my favorite moments as a student at Michigan.

## Extra Extra Notes

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "A Mermaid diagram of the difficult decisions I have to make every day."
%%| code-fold: false
flowchart LR
  A[Wake Up] --> B(Eat Food)
  B --> C{Decide Plans}
  C --> D[Do Schoolwork]
  C --> E[Watch TV]
  C --> F[Sleep]
```

Not mentioned in the mermaid diagram above is the decision to spend time thinking about football. According to recent studies [@kuzmits2008nfl], thinking about football increases IQ exponentially.
